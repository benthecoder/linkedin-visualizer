## Features

This app tells you the information below

- Total connections on LinkedIn
- Where most of your connections work at
- Who most of your connections are (what job title they hold)
- Who you last connected with
- Who you first connected with (send them a message!)
- Bar chart of top companies and positions
- Time series plot of your connections over time (find out when you had the most connections)
- A graph/network of your connections (see your connections in a graph)
- A wordcloud of your chat messages with your connections _(new!)_
- Last but not least, a "who you can cold email" section that provides a list of emails of your connections (perks of LinkedIn connections!)
